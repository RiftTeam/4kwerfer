# README #

Go project for a new, decoupled tool. Idea: use any editor you want for shader manipulation, use web tools where it makes sense (e.g. webmidi) because of platform specific nightmares.

### How do I get set up? ###

* set up go ([golang](https://golang.org/doc/install))

Development:

* clone repo to `$GOPATH/bitbucket.org/realrift/go-shader-tool`
* happy editing

Just usage:

* `go get bitbucket.org/realrift/go-shader-tool`
