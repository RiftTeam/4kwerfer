# README #

Go project for a new, decoupled tool. Idea: use any editor you want for shader manipulation, use web tools where it makes sense (e.g. webmidi) because of platform specific nightmares.

### How do I get set up? ###

* set up go ([golang](https://golang.org/doc/install))

Development:

* clone repo
* happy editing

Just usage:

* `go get bitbucket.org/realrift/go-shader-tool`


### Contribution guidelines ###

* DO THE DAMN BRANCH THING!

### Who do I talk to? ###

* That skomp guy or whoever you want to talk to...


# Open TODOs:

[] make it work again on mac (migrate gl lib?)
[] add some time controls (loop, start offset, ...)
[] add sound from wav?
